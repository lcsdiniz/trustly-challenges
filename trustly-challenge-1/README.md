# Trustly Challenge #1
Challenge1:
The challenge is to find a way to use the API (http://worldclockapi.com/): It could be a simple page (you don't need to care about design or layout), some curl's examples or Postman's documentation.

## 🧾 Requirements
 - You need to display the results on screen;
 - You need to use JavaScript or related programing language (i.e. NodeJS, ReactJS and others);
 - We must understand your code and use your API without having to ask you any questions. Our primary language is English so please use it on comments and documentation;
 - We’d like to see SOLID principles in your solution;
 - You don’t need to persist any data (but feel free to do it if you want);

## 🏁 Get started
 ```bash
  yarn start
```
